Customer Segmentation Using KMeans Clustering

📌 Overview

Customer segmentation is crucial in data science, enabling businesses to gain a deeper understanding of their customer base. For this project, I applied KMeans clustering to categorize online retail customers into distinct segments, providing valuable insights that can drive data-informed decisions and enhance customer experiences.
In this project, I followed a structured approach using Python and machine learning libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and seaborn to preprocess, cluster, and visualize the customer data effectively.

🚀 What I Learned

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:
📊 Importing and preprocessing customer data using pandas.
🔍 Applying KMeans clustering to uncover distinct customer segments.
📈 Visualizing clustering results with seaborn and matplotlib for clear insights.
🎯 Interpreting segmentation results to inform customer engagement and business strategies.

📂 Dataset
The dataset I used contains transaction records from an online retail store, focusing on key metrics like:
Recency: Days since the last purchase
Frequency: Number of transactions made
MonetaryValue: Total amount spent

🏗️ Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing: I started by cleaning and preparing the dataset to ensure accuracy.
Feature Scaling: Normalizing the data to ensure that clustering works effectively.
KMeans Clustering: I applied the KMeans algorithm to segment customers into meaningful groups.
Cluster Analysis: I analyzed the segments to understand the unique characteristics of each group.
Data Visualization: I created insightful plots using seaborn and matplotlib to visualize the customer clusters.

📊 Results & Insights
After clustering, I was able to categorize customers into different segments such as:
High-value, infrequent buyers
Loyal, frequent customers
Low-spending, occasional shoppers
